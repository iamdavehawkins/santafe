Wrote you a letter from Santa fe
Wont get to you until saturday
Turns out I had a lot of stuff to say
To you
About you

I got some time to kill until then
Might go swimmin at the rec center
My head
Underwater
Cool it down

I just need to clear my mind for a minute
I just put my pen to the paper and sent it

My favorite artist has a gallery
On the street with five new airbnbs
But not one
Has hung
A piece

I watch the people squeezed on tiny sidewalks
And we're all breathing one asshole's exhaust
Aint it great
All of us
Share the space

I just need to clear my mind for a minute
I just put my pen to the paper and sent it

I never knew the desert had snowy mountains
The lady pouring can't stop talking about em
She skis
But her knees
Aren't great

The mall is empty, but it feels full
The kids are alright, but they're miserable
And I walk
And I see
They dont talk

I just need to clear my mind for a minute
I just put my pen to the paper and sent it
